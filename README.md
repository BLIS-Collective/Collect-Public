# Collect-Public

BLIS stands for Black Liberation-Indigenous Sovereignty.

Weâ€™re a cross-movement Solidarity & Action Hub braiding narratives and growing movements to win policy and shift culture.

We are born out of the idea that we must repair the damages done to Black and Indigenous people in what we now call the United States and cultivate a culture of solidarity so that every individual, no matter their identity, has equal opportunity to live life freely and fully.

This BLIS Collective Public Repository providers researchers, organizers, and advocates access to our research data, code, and replication files, in order to advance our Narrative Research strategic goals
