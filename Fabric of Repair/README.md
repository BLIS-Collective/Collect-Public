# Fabric of Repair

The contained files provide data and replication code for BLIS Collectiveâ€™s Fabric of Repair Report (2025): <https://www.bliscollective.org/s/Fabric-of-Repair_Full-Version_LONG.pdf> The data were collected by Swayable in early 2025 and analyzed internally by the BLIS Collective research team (PI: Dr. Camilla Griffiths). The data are provided as a .csv `replication_swayable_2025.csv` in the /data folder and are merged from two waves of data collection. This data is then limited by our sampling requirements regarding Indigenous populations. The /code folder contains R code to reproduce the report tables, figures and analyses from the merged dataset, and the documentation folder includes the survey instrument, for reference.

Further questions about the data/variables, methodology, and code can be directed to the PI at [camilla\@bliscollective.org](mailto:camilla@bliscollective.org){.email}.
